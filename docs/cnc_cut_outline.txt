    CNC lets cut material directly from computer design file (dxf, stl, g-code ...)This ensures precision, reproducibility, shape-complexity and automation.    The 3-axis CNC can process:- 2.5D : xy-path at z constant- 3D: xyz-path (if ad-hoc router_bit and particular path)    Cutting technology:- laser cutter (Only 2.5D: cutting and engraving)- water jet (Only 2.5D)- router_bit / mechanical (2.5D and 3D depending on shape and router_bit shape)    Minimal curve radius constraint:- laser and water-jet implies no specific constraint- For mechanical cutter, inner curve must have a curve radius bigger than the router_bit radius.

    So inner corner can not be cut with router_bit.They must be replaced by inner curve.Tight inner curve must be smoothed to respect the minimal curve radius constraint.

    If you want a perfect fitting between two coplanar shapes,then outer corners and outer curves must be rounded to get a minimum curve radius bigger than the router_bit radius.For a perfect fitting, the coplanar shapes must be complementary.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    If two 2D shapes are not coplanar, then outer corners can not be rounded by 2.5D cnc.
